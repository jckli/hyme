# Hyme

A simple and private music bot for Discord written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Utilizes [disgo](https://github.com/DisgoOrg/disgo) and [disgolink](https://github.com/DisgoOrg/disgolink) (a [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink) client).

Used for my own personal servers. If you want to add it, heres the link: https://jackli.dev/hyme. (though if it hits 100 servers, I might remove it from some servers)
